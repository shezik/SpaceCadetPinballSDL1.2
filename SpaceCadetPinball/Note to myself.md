When rotozoom returns a new surface it'll **always** be in RGBA32 format.

1. Create new surface. Size is determined by srcrect, need not to tackle its alpha-ness.
2. Blit from source surface (rect) to new surface.
3. Use SDL_gfx to stretch new surface to size of dstrect. This also creates a new surface.
4. Blit new-new surface to destination surface. Blend mode should be set by user before calling SDL_RenderCopy.

Stretch source surface first to optimize one step?
1. Use SDL_gfx to stretch source surface to match dstrect's dimensions, involving srcrect and math and stuff. This creates a new surface.
2. Calculate what the new srcrect should be, then use it to blit to destination surface.

Is creating multiple surfaces first faster or is streching a big surface faster?  
Implement both then profile. (I kinda think the first one's faster...?)

If the surface needs to be rotated then the second method won't work.

What is going on at line 496 in render.cpp?

Explicit conversion of types inside SDL_Rect at line 139 in fullscrn.cpp.  
Explicit conversion of int to SDLKey at line 571 in options.cpp.

Check delta time calculation.
Copy palette, build in release mode.

Get over the `rtn = !rtn ? do_something() : rtn;` stuff.
